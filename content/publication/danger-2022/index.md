abstract: "Benchmark datasets for autonomous driving, such as KITTI,
Argoverse, or Waymo are realistic, but they are designed to be too
idealistic. These datasets do not contain errors, difficult driving
maneuvers, or other corner cases. We propose a framework for
perturbing autonomous vehicle datasets, the DANGER framework, which
generates edge-case images on top of current autonomous driving
datasets.  The input to DANGER is a photorealistic datasets from real
driving scenarios. We present the DANGER algorithm for vehicle
position manipulation and the interface towards the renderer module,
and present primitive generation cases applied to the virtual KITTI
dataset. Our experiments prove that DANGER can be used as a framework
for enlarging the current dataset to cover generative corner cases."
