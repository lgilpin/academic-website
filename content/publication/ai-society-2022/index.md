abstract: "In this paper, we outline a new method for evaluating the
human impact of machine-learning (ML) applications. In partnership
with Underwriters Laboratories Inc., we have developed a framework to
evaluate the impacts of a particular use of machine learning that is
based on the goals and values of the domain in which that application
is deployed. By examining the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in
particular domains, such as journalism, criminal justice, or law, we
can develop more nuanced and practically relevant understandings of
key ethical guidelines for artificial intelligence. By decoupling the
extraction of the facts of the matter from the evaluation of the
impact of the resulting systems, we create a framework for the process
of assessing impact that has two distinctly different phases."
