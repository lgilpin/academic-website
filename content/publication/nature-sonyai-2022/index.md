abstract: "Many potential applications of artificial intelligence
involve making real-time decisions in physical systems while
interacting with humans. Automobile racing represents an extreme
example of these conditions; drivers must execute complex tactical
manoeuvres to pass or block opponents while operating their vehicles
at their traction limits1. Racing simulations, such as the PlayStation
game Gran Turismo, faithfully reproduce the non-linear control
challenges of real race cars while also encapsulating the complex
multi-agent interactions. Here we describe how we trained agents for
Gran Turismo that can compete with the world’s best e-sports
drivers. We combine state-of-the-art, model-free, deep reinforcement
learning algorithms with mixed-scenario training to learn an
integrated control policy that combines exceptional speed with
impressive tactics. In addition, we construct a reward function that
enables the agent to be competitive while adhering to racing’s
important, but under-specified, sportsmanship rules. We demonstrate
the capabilities of our agent, Gran Turismo Sophy, by winning a
head-to-head competition against four of the world’s best Gran Turismo
drivers. By describing how we trained championship-level racers, we
demonstrate the possibilities and challenges of using these techniques
to control complex dynamical systems in domains where agents must
respect imprecisely defined human norms."
