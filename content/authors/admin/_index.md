I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at UC
Santa Cruz.  Previously, I was a research scientist at Sony AI working
on explainability in AI agents.  I graduated with my PhD in Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science at MIT in CSAIL, where I continue as
a collaborating researcher.  During my PhD, I developed "Anomaly
Detection through Explanations" or ADE, a self-explaining, full system
monitoring architecture to detect and explain inconsistencies in
autonomous vehicles.  This allows machines and other complex
mechanisms to be able to interpret their actions and learn from their
mistakes.

My research focuses on the theories and methodologies towards
monitoring, designing, and augmenting complex machines that can
**explain** themselves for diagnosis, accountability, and
liability. My long-term research vision is for self-explaining,
intelligent, machines by design.

I am currently looking for motivated PhD students; please see [this post](post/recruiting/) and
reach out to me on Twitter or by email if the above description
interests you!
