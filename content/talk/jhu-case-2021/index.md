summary:
abstract: "Autonomous systems are prone to errors and failures without knowing
why.  In critical domains like driving, these autonomous
counterparts must be able to recount their actions for safety,
liability, and trust.  An explanation: a model-dependent reason or
justification for the decision of the autonomous agent being
assessed, is a key component for post-mortem failure analysis, but
also for pre-deployment verification.  I will show a monitoring
framework that uses a model and commonsense knowledge to detect and
explain unreasonable vehicle scenarios, even if it has not seen that
error before.

In the second part of the talk, I will motivate the explanations as a
testing framework for autonomous systems.  While it is important to
develop realistic tests in simulation, simulation is not always
representative of the corner cases in the real world.  I will show how
to use explanations in a feedback loop.  The explanation ensures that
the machine has done the right thing or it exploits a stressor to be
modified and tested moving forward.  I will conclude by discussing new
challenges at the intersection of XAI and autonomy towards autonomous
systems that are explainable by design"
